## 📌 Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? 
 
This project provides a Power BI dashboard to support strategic decision-making. The objective is:  

- Understand company-wide sales performance

- Identify top products & regions for market expansion

- Support senior management in selecting strategic products 

### 👤 Who is this project for?  

✔️ Senior managers & business decision-makers  

✔️ Strategy teams exploring market expansion  

✔️ Product managers evaluating performance  

✔️ Data analysts supporting executive insights  

###  ❓Business Questions:  
✔️ Which products generate the most revenue and profit?  

✔️ What are the top-performing regions or markets?  

✔️ Which customer segments are the most valuable?  

✔️ Are there markets with growth potential we haven’t tapped into yet?  

✔️ What trends can inform our product and market expansion strategies?  

### 🎯Project Outcome:  
✔️ Profit Margin Decline in 2014:
Despite a strong revenue increase (+24% vs. 2013), the company experienced a slight drop in overall profit margin (from 11.97% to 11.51%) due to rising operational costs.

✔️ Shift Toward Costly Shipping Methods:
There was an increase in order volume using high-cost shipping methods, especially First Class (+33%) and Same Day (+25%), which led to faster growth in shipping expenses than in gross profit.

✔️ Suboptimal Product Mix Impacting Margins:
The surge in Office Supplies orders—typically low-margin products—combined with costly shipping methods, contributed to the margin decline.

✔️ Return Rate Remained Stable:
Return rates in key markets (APAC, EU, US) remained steady (around 5–7%) and were not a major driver of profit decline.

✔️ High-Margin Niche Market Identified:
Canada, though a small market (Revenue: 0.05M), achieved the highest profit margin (27.59%), with Copiers contributing 38% of total profit—highlighting a highly efficient product-market fit.

✔️ Expansion Opportunity Identified:
Recommend a targeted expansion into Canada, focusing on high-margin products like Copiers, while avoiding scale-up of low-margin categories such as Office Supplies.
